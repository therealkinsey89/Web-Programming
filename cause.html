            <h2 class="abam">Right to Repair</h2>
            <p class="abam-text">
                Right to repair is fairly well known within the technology industry. This is the concept of allowing consumers of technology the ability to repair their electronics. Not only does this apply to the people who buy their own electronics, but also for third party electronic repair stores. By eliminating the right to repair, consumers are forced to make a decision. They may choose to repair the device themselves anyway, which will likely void any warranty. They could try to have a third party repair store fix the electronic device and hope that they are not faced with a cease and desist letter from the large corporation that produced the product. Or finally, the consumer could give into the large corporation and either pay way more for a repair than what is necessary, or even worse, have to buy a brand new device to replace.

            <p class="hai-text">
                There are a few ways to fight for the right to repair. While some are bolder decisions to make and some are seemingly smaller, they are all impactful in some way. Firstly, you could only buy products from organizations that support the right to repair. The biggest example is Apple versus Android. Apple does not support right to repair while Android is based on a more open-sourced model. Secondly, you can support local third party repair stores by going to them for help with electronics problems that you do not feel comfortable fixing yourself. This would likely save you a good chunk of money as well! And finally, you can be vocal in your defense against the movement to get rid of right to repair. Standing up and being bold in that way can go a long way!
